// Given the roots of two binary trees root and subRoot, return true if there is a subtree of root with the same structure and node values of subRoot and false otherwise.

// A subtree of a binary tree tree is a tree that consists of a node in tree and all of this node's descendants. The tree tree could also be considered as a subtree of itself.

 

// Example 1:


// Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2], subRoot = [4,1,2]
// Output: true
// Example 2:


// Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2,null,null,null,null,0], subRoot = [4,1,2]
// Output: false
 

// Constraints:

// The number of nodes in the root tree is in the range [1, 2000].
// The number of nodes in the subRoot tree is in the range [1, 1000].
// -104 <= root.val <= 104
// -104 <= subRoot.val <= 104


// Hint 1:
// Which approach is better here- recursive or iterative?

// Hint 2:
// If recursive approach is better, can you write recursive function with its parameters?

// Hint 3:
// Two trees s and t are said to be identical if their root values are same and their left and right subtrees are identical. Can you write this in form of recursive formulae?

// Hint 4:
// Recursive formulae can be: isIdentical(s,t)= s.val==t.val AND isIdentical(s.left,t.left) AND isIdentical(s.right,t.right)
