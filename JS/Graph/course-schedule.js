// There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.

// For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.
// Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.



// Example 1:

// Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
// Output: true
// Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
// To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
// Example 2:

// Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
// Output: false
// Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
// To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.


// Constraints:

// 1 <= numCourses <= 10^5
// 0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000
// prerequisites[i].length == 2
// 0 <= ai, bi < numCourses
// All the pairs prerequisites[i] are unique.

// Hint 1:
// This problem is equivalent to finding if a cycle exists in a directed graph. If a cycle exists, no topological ordering exists and therefore it will be impossible to take all courses.

// Hint 2:

// Topological Sort via DFS - A great video tutorial (21 minutes) on Coursera explaining the basic concepts of Topological Sort.

// Hint 3:
// Topological sort could also be done via BFS.
