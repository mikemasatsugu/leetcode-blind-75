// You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

// You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

// Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.



// Example 1:

// Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
// Output: 5
// Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
// Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
// Example 2:

// Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
// Output: 0
// Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.


// Constraints:

// 1 <= prices.length <= 10^5
// 0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4

/**
 * @param {number[]} prices
 * @return {number}
 */

Quick Look:
*** The approach below mutates the input array = if this is not okay, create a shallow copy of the input array and modify accordingly.

Set a variable to the first possible buy - first index of prices
Set a value 'profit' at 0 (the day we purchase, profit will be 0);

iterate through input array
If the current value is less than the last value we "bought" at, we should make the current value our new buy since profit margin is higher
If we do this, we need to reset our newest "buy" to the current value

If the current value is NOT less than the last buy value, we recalculate our highest profit by taking the max between current price - buy price, and our profit at each step


After the iteration is finished, return the max profit found

var maxProfit = function (prices) {
  let buy = prices[0];
  let profit = 0;

  for (let i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {

    } else {
      profit = Math.max(prices[i] - buy, profit);
    }

  return profit;
