// Given an m x n matrix, return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.



//   Example 1:


// Input: matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
// Output: [1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 8, 7, 4, 5]
// Example 2:


// Input: matrix = [[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12]]
// Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 11, 10, 9, 5, 6, 7]


// Constraints:

// m == matrix.length
// n == matrix[i].length
// 1 <= m, n <= 10
//   - 100 <= matrix[i][j] <= 100

// Hint 1:
// Well for some problems, the best way really is to come up with some algorithms for simulation. Basically, you need to simulate what the problem asks us to do.

// Hint 2:
// We go boundary by boundary and move inwards. That is the essential operation. First row, last column, last row, first column and then we move inwards by 1 and then repeat. That's all, that is all the simulation that we need.

// Hint 3:
// Think about when you want to switch the progress on one of the indexes. If you progress on
// i
// out of
// [i, j]
// , you'd be shifting in the same column. Similarly, by changing values for
// j
// , you'd be shifting in the same row. Also, keep track of the end of a boundary so that you can move inwards and then keep repeating. It's always best to run the simulation on edge cases like a single column or a single row to see if anything breaks or not.
